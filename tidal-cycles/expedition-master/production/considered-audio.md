## Tracks that made the cut but weren't possible

- _milestone_: I couldn't find the source code. I tried reproducing
this track with new code and samples but couldn't produce a version
that had the spirit of the original
- _ffiivvee_: I couldn't find the source code, and I couldn't reproduce
a suitable new version
- _pattern 416_: the original uses a lot of samples that weren't my own original work, and I didn't feel I could reproduce it with the same
musical integrity
- _atmospheric probe malfunction_: I couldn't find the source code
for the original, but used the same title and created a new track


# EP for another time...
These tracks could have made the cut but I felt that they were
so related that they should be considered for their own release:

- pattern 381
- pattern 380
- pattern 379

# Even another EP...
I may plan on releasing _Warm Waves_ on an EP someday. I'm fond of it
because it's live-coded on the fly, but didn't feel it fit on this
release.


# Didn't Make the Cut
Ultimately I didn't think these tracks fit or weren't good enough:

- pattern 392
- pattern 415
- pattern 404
- pattern 382
- pattern 419
- pattern 420
- pattern 403
- adrift no reserve
- pattern 313
- pattern 405
- pattern 418
